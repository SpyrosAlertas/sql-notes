\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} In this document I try to cover a vast content of concepts of
\aclp{DB}, some more basic and useful to any role while others are more advanced. I tried to write the content in a linear to follow way so that even with little experience one can follow to learn.
\paragraph{} \acs{SQL} commands are tested using My\acs{SQL} version 8. If you are using different Major version or different \acs{DBMS}, commands might slightly differ in some cases, however the concepts should be the same. In most cases I try to provide the equivalent commands for Oracle \acs{SQL} as well (tested on version 12c).
