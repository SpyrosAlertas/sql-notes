\paragraph{} There are three types of tables relationships.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{One to One:} For each record in the primary table, there can be only one record in the foreign table. It can be achieved by using the primary key of the foreign table as foreign key with unique constraint.
	\item \textbf{One to Many:} For each record in the primary table, there can be many records in the foreign table, but for each record in the foreign table, there can be only one record in the primary table. It can be achieved by using the primary key of the foreign table as foreign key.
	\item \textbf{Many to Many:} For each record in the primary table, there can be many records in the foreign table, but also for the foreign table there can be many records in the primary table. It can be achieved by using a third table, that will consist of the primary keys of the two tables.
\end{enumerate}
